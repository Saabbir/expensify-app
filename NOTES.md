# Path issue

Make sure the project path doesn't contain character hash (#). This will cause webpack build error.

# Environments

Use following exact node.js and npm version if you face any error with latest node.js and npm version.

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "14.21.1",
  "npm": "6.14.17"
}
```
